# NYT Spelling Bee in Google Sheets

Like it says on the tin. Open the xlsx in Google Sheets, select Extensions, Apps Script, and paste the gs file into it. Save.

Pangrams denoted with an exclamation mark at the end.

Scoring done automatically.

Check the shuffle box to shuffle, once the gs is loaded.

Great for cooperative/long-distance Spelling Bee collaboration.
